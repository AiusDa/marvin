## What is this?

Boilerplate I extracted from a small real world project.

Webpack 2 is still in beta, but at this point is the only version
that I managed to run everything I wanted, including hot module replacement.

This boilerplate includes complete, minimal react app.
By complete I mean it has examples for:

- components (both container/views and regular ones)
- routes
- reducers (redux)
- actions (both sync and async),
- SASS (with autoprefixer)<sup>1</sup>
- dummy API
- using assets (in CSS and components)
- imports relative to the app root

<sup>1</sup> Using source maps breaks urls in the CSS loader - https://github.com/webpack/css-loader/issues/296

It is using [webpack dashboard](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard), so please note the following:

**OS X Terminal.app users:** Make sure that **View â†’ Allow Mouse Reporting** is enabled, otherwise scrolling through logs and modules won't work. If your version of Terminal.app doesn't have this feature, you may want to check out an alternative such as [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/).

## Build (production)

Build will be placed in the `build` folder.

```
$ npm run build
```

## Linting

For linting I'm using [eslint-config-airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb),
but some options are overridden to my personal preferences.

```
$ npm run lint
```
